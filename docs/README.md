## Btvep

In this documentation you will find examples on how to use the backend part of the valdiator-endpoint repository. The backend is called `btvep` (
**B**it**t**ensor **V**alidator **E**nd**p**oint) and contains an API server, Database (SQLite) and a CLI. It's the core of the repository which the `chat-ui` and `admin-ui` connects to.

- [cli.md](./cli.md) - `btvep` CLI reference
- [requests.md](./requests.md) - A guide for making requests. Examples with python and curl.
- [docker.md](./docker.md) - A guide for using docker to host `btvep`.
